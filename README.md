# Heuristics-for-LABS
Design, Implementation, and Testing of Heuristics for the Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence (LABS) problem
In this project, the aim is to implement, test, and compare heuristic search algorithms for Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence (LABS). 
The goal in LABS problem is to maximize the merit, which has various applications in different areas of science. 
In this project, two (1+1)EA and simulated annealing algorithms are implemented in C++. 
Although there are more criteria which should be considered, these algorithms are compared together with respect to the merit they found and the time they consumed. 
The results show that (1+1)EA obtains better results, in the implementations of this project; while simulated annealing consumed less time.
